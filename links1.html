    <h4>Mapping a constrution site:</h4>
    The process involved in mapping a construction site used to be long and difficult, but with the help of the right
    drone, all that has changed. Not only was it a lengthy process but it was also expensive. Construction companies
    undertaking large projects had to hire a plane to fly over their large sites to take the needed pictures.

    Nowadays, a drone can be programmed to carry out the process in a few short minutes at a fraction of the cost. This
    lets you get the images much more easily and in less time. It also means that builders on smaller projects can get
    the right data where they were previously priced out of hiring a plane while eliminating the chances of getting
    wrong data.

    Not only that, but you can also get current images every day to monitor the construction progress if you need to.
    These drones can also send the appropriate data straight to the right software on a computer so that it can be
    analysed and compiled in real time. From there, it can be stored and used to create a number of different solutions.

    <h4>Construction site inspections</h4>
    Inspections on a busy construction site can be dangerous – but they’ve become a lot safer with drones. The health
    and safety risks to employees can be reduced drastically by allowing drones to carry out most of the work, while
    managers view the footage from the safety of their office, whether real-time or recorded.

    Bridge inspection companies have discovered that the use of drones is the best way to complete inspections of
    structures that are close to the water. Drones have the ability to fly to remote locations, a task that would have
    taken a group of builders a few days to get to. Drones are also useful during insurance claims, as they are used to
    provide evidence of construction progress.

    <h4>Building surveillence</h4>

    In the process of carrying out a building survey, accessing the roof can often be dangerous and difficult. Building
    surveillance using drones can identify potentially unsafe situations, so they are addressed faster.

    Drones can help make the process safer, easier and quicker and allows a surveyor to assess the roof for faults
    without actually getting on the roof. This means surveyors won’t need scaffolding or ladders and will, therefore, be
    much safer, and the cost, cheaper.

    While the use of drones has many advantages on a construction site, there are also a few challenges. Let’s have a
    quick look at them:

    Commercial drones normally need two people with technical knowledge of drones to operate them. They’ll also need to
    be experienced with that particular type of drone, especially the sensor. Apart from being experienced in drone
    control, these operators will need to have full knowledge of the route.
    You might also experience problems with using drones in certain weather conditions that prevent the drone from
    working correctly or flying at all. Weather conditions like heavy wind or thick cloud cover can prevent a drone from
    flying safely and can stop the right and clear images from being taken. Operating drones under these kinds of
    conditions can cause delays and might eventually lead to a collection of wrong data. Strong winds can also lead to
    the drone being swept away and losing connection with the controller, or worse, its destruction.
    Purchasing drones can also be expensive and have a large up-front cost. Despite the fact that companies save a lot
    of money in the long run after you buy drones, the initial buying cost can seem huge and make them less interested.
    However, the good news is that it seems like there will be a reduction in the price of drones over the next few
    years.
    A massive increase in the use of drones is inevitable as more businesses realise its full potential. A recent study
    suggests that over 25% of construction professionals plan to use drones in their operations by 2020. As more
    advances are made in drone technology, it will offer more benefits and be generally more useful.
