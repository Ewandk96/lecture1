    The term lean construction was coined by the International Group for Lean Construction in its first meeting in 1993
    (Gleeson et al. 2007). Greg Howell and Glenn Ballard (founders of the Lean Construction Institute in 1997) both
    maintain that Construction in Lean Construction refers to the entire industry and not the phase during which
    construction takes place. Thus, Lean Construction is for owners, architects, designers, engineers, constructors,
    suppliers & end users.

    In any case, the term Lean Construction has escaped canonical definition. There has been a number of reasons for
    that. The body of knowledge is in a state of development since 1990. Nonetheless, a definition is needed to be able
    to operationalize the concepts and principles contained in the philosophy. It is insightful to study the change of
    definition over time as that represents the evolution and advancement in the state of knowledge about Lean
    Construction.

    The reference to Lean Construction as a proper noun is not an attempt to falsely distinguish it from other areas
    that focus on construction project management. It is a proper noun because it refers to a very specific set of
    concepts, principles, and practices that are distinct from conventional design and construction management practices
    .

    A number of groups have proposed definitions: The International Group for Lean Construction; The Lean Construction
    Institute; The Associated General Contractors of America; Construction Management Association of America, and
    others. Researchers have also put forward definitions as foundation for their work and to invite others to add,
    modify and critique. A sampling is provided here.

    Lean Construction is a â€œway to design production systems to minimize waste of materials, time, and effort in order
    to generate the maximum possible amount of value," (Koskela et al. 2002[1]). Designing a production system to
    achieve the stated ends is only possible through the collaboration of all project participants (Owner, A/E,
    contractors, Facility Managers, End-user) at early stages of the project. This goes beyond the contractual
    arrangement of design/build or constructability reviews where contractors, and sometime facility managers, merely
    react to designs instead of informing and influencing the design (Abdelhamid et al. 2008).

    Lean Construction recognizes that desired ends affect the means to achieve these ends, and that available means will
    affect realized ends (Lichtig 2004). Essentially, Lean Construction aims to embody the benefits of the Master
    Builder concept (Abdelhamid et al. 2008).

    "One can think of lean construction in a way similar to mesoeconomics. Lean construction draws upon the principles
    of project-level management and upon the principles that govern production-level management. Lean construction
    recognizes that any successful project undertaking will inevitably involve the interaction between project and
    production management." (Abdelhamid 2007)

    Lean construction supplements traditional construction management approaches with (Abdelhamid 2007): (1) two
    critical and necessary dimensions for successful capital project delivery by requiring the deliberate consideration
    of material and information flow and value generation in a production system; and (2) different project and
    production management (planning-execution-control) paradigms.

    While lean construction is identical to lean production in spirit, it is different in how it was conceived as well
    as how it is practiced. There is a view that "adaptation" of Lean Manufacturing/Production forms the basis of Lean
    Construction. The view of Lauri Koskela, Greg Howell, and Glenn Ballard is very different, with the origin of lean
    construction arising mainly from the need for a production theory in construction and anomalies that were observed
    in the reliability of weekly production planning.

    Getting work to flow reliably and predictably on a construction site requires the impeccable alignment of the entire
    supply chain responsible for constructed facilities such that value is maximized and waste is minimized. With such a
    broad scope, it is fair to say that tools found in Lean Manufacturing and Lean Production, as practiced by Toyota
    and others, have been adapted to be used in the fulfillment of Lean construction principles. TQM, SPC, six-sigma,
    have all found their way into lean construction. Similarly, tools and methods found in other areas, such as in
    social science and business, are used where they are applicable. The tools and methods in construction management,
    such as CPM and work breakdown structure, etc., are also utilized in lean construction implementations. The three
    unique tools and methods that were specifically conceived for lean construction are the Last Planner System, Target
    Value Design, and the Lean Project Delivery System.

    If the tool, method, and/or technique will assist in fulfilling the aims of lean construction, it is considered a
    part of the toolkit available for use. A sampling of these tools includes: BIM (Lean Design), A3, process design
    (Lean Design), offsite fabrication and JIT (Lean Supply), value chain mapping (Lean Assembly), visual site (Lean
    Assembly); 5S (Lean Assembly), daily crew huddles (Lean Assembly).

    The priority for all construction work is to:
    <ol>
      <li>Keep work flowing so that the crews are always productive installing product</li>
      <li>Reduce inventory of material and tools and</li>
      <li>Reduce costs</li>
    </ol>
